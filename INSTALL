The following libraries are required to compile the project:

	- Gurobi 4.0.0: we have only tried 32 bits library
	- pthreads: required by Gurobi
	- Qt 4.7 
	  * It works with other versions of Qt 4, but version 4.7 changed some
	    behaviour of timers and threads. As a consequence, program CSGUI 
		crashes using older versions when all threads die, saying the timer 
		we use to count the elapsed time cannot be stopped from another
		thread (but it actually is from the same thread).
		However, as the image is saved before stopping the timer, we think
		this is only a "minor bug".

Then, just execute from the root folder (the one that contains 'cs.pro')
	qmake
	make

If everything is ok, the result will be three programs:
	CSCLI: command line version of the reconstructor
	CSGUI: graphic interface version of the reconstructor
	GEN:   utility to create holes to ppm files
